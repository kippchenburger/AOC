# Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). 
# A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only 
# get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. 
# A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.

# The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: 
# x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.

# For example:

# 123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.
# x AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.
# p LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.
# NOT e -> f means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.
# Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason, 
# you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages 
# (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.

# For example, here is a simple circuit:
import operator

data ="""123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i"""

#After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:
# d: 72
# e: 507
# f: 492
# g: 114
# h: 65412
# i: 65079
# x: 123
# y: 456

# In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?

#  Operator      Example	Meaning
#  &	         a & b	    Bitwise AND
#  |	         a | b   	Bitwise OR
#  ^	         a ^ b	    Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
#  ~	          ~a	    Bitwise NOT
#  <<	         a << n	    Bitwise left shift
#  >>	         a >> n	    Bitwise right shift
