# Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; 
# the lights at each corner are at 0,0, 0,999, 999,999, and 999,0. 
# The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various 
# inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair 
# represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate 
# pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.

# To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your 
# lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.

# For example:

# turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light.
# toggle 0,0 through 999,0 would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, 
# and turning on the ones that were off.
# turn off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.
# After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?

#Part II
# The phrase turn on actually means that you should increase the brightness of those lights by 1.
# The phrase turn off actually means that you should decrease the brightness of those lights by 1, to a minimum of zero.
# The phrase toggle actually means that you should increase the brightness of those lights by 2.
# What is the total brightness of all lights combined after following Santa's instructions?
