# Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.
# He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, 
# and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next. 
# Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), east (>), or west (<). 
# After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.
# However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, 
# and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once. 
# How many houses receive at least one present?
# For example:
# > delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.
# ^>v< delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.
# ^v^v^v^v^v delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only 2 houses.
