# Action N means to move north by the given value.
# Action S means to move south by the given value.
# Action E means to move east by the given value.
# Action W means to move west by the given value.
# Action L means to turn left the given number of degrees.
# Action R means to turn right the given number of degrees.
# Action F means to move forward by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.
# The ship starts by facing east. Only the L and R actions change the direction the ship is facing. 
# (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is N10, the ship would 
# move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were F.)

# F10 would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.
# N3 would move the ship 3 units north to east 10, north 3.
# F7 would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to east 17, north 3.
# R90 would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face south; it remains at east 17, north 3.
# F11 would move the ship 11 units south to east 17, south 8.
# 
# At the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute values 
# of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.
# Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. What is the Manhattan distance between 
# that location and the ship's starting position?
