# For example, suppose you have the following list:

data = """1-3 a: abcde
 1-3 b: cdefg
 2-9 c: ccccccccc"""
# Each line gives the password policy and then the password. 
# The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given 
# letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that 
# the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

# In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; 
# it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. 
# The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within 
# the limits of their respective policies.

# How many passwords are valid according to their policies?

# Part 2
# Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the 
# first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be careful; 
# Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!) Exactly one of these positions 
# must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.

# Given the same example list from above:

# 1-3 a: abcde is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
# 1-3 b: cdefg is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
# 2-9 c: ccccccccc is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
# How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?
