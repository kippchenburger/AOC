# In addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for 3 jolts higher than 
# the highest-rated adapter in your bag. (If your adapter list were 3, 9, and 6, your device's 
# built-in adapter would be rated for 12 jolts.)
# Treat the charging outlet near your seat as having an effective joltage rating of 0.

# With these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated for 
# 19 + 3 = 22 jolts, 3 higher than the highest-rated adapter.

# In this example, when using every adapter, there are 7 differences of 1 jolt and 5 
# differences of 3 jolts.

# Find a chain that uses all of your adapters to connect the charging outlet to 
# your device's built-in adapter and count the joltage differences between the 
# charging outlet, the adapters, and your device. 
# What is the number of 1-jolt differences multiplied by the number of 3-jolt differences?
