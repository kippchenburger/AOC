# This list represents answers from six groups:

# That top group there are 6 questions to which anyone answered "yes": a, b, c, x, y, and z. 
# (Duplicate answers to the same question don't count extra; each question counts at most once.)
# The first group contains one person who answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
# The second group contains three people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
# The third group contains two people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
# The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered "yes" to only 1 question, a.
# The last group contains one person who answered "yes" to only 1 question, b.
# In this example, the sum of these counts is 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 17.

# For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
# Part 2
# For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
