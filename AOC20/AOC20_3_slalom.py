# the same pattern repeats to the right many times
# You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need 
# to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
# start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
# 
# part 2: Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:
# Right 1, down 1.
# Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
# Right 5, down 1.
# Right 7, down 1.
# Right 1, down 2.
# In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively; 
# multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.
# What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?
