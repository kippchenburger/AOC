# The boot code is represented as a text file with one instruction per line of text. 
# Each instruction consists of an operation (acc, jmp, or nop) and an argument (a signed number like +4 or -20).
# acc increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given in the argument. 
# For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at 0. After an acc instruction, 
# the instruction immediately below it is executed next.
# jmp jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the 
# argument as an offset from the jmp instruction; for example, jmp +2 would skip the next instruction, 
# jmp +1 would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and jmp -20 would cause the instruction 20 lines 
# above to be executed next.
# nop stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.
# For example, consider the following program:

data = """nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6"""

# These instructions are visited in this order:
# nop +0  | 1
# acc +1  | 2, 8(!)
# jmp +4  | 3
# acc +3  | 6
# jmp -3  | 7
# acc -99 |
# acc +1  | 4
# jmp -4  | 5
# acc +6  |
# First, the nop +0 does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (acc +1) 
# and jmp +4 sets the next instruction to the other acc +1 near the bottom. 
# After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, jmp -4 executes, setting the next 
# instruction to the only acc +3. It sets the accumulator to 5, and jmp -3 causes the program to 
# continue back at the first acc +1.

# This is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the 
# program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.
# Immediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is 5.
# Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, what value is in the accumulator?
