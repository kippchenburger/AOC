# Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 
# and then multiply those two numbers together.

# For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

# In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them 
# together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
