# XMAS starts by transmitting a preamble of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive 
# should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers. 
# The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.

# In this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two 
# of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is 127.

# The first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number 
# in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. 
# What is the first number that does not have this property?

# part 2
# you must find a contiguous set of at least two numbers in your list which sum to 
# the invalid number from step 1
# In this list, adding up all of the numbers from 15 through 40 produces the invalid 
# number from step 1, 127. (Of course, the contiguous set of numbers in your actual list might 
# be much longer.)

# To find the encryption weakness, add together the smallest and largest number in this 
# contiguous range; in this example, these are 15 and 47, producing 62.
