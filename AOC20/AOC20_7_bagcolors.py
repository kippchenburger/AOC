# (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)

# In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

# A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
# A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
# A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
# A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
# So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.
